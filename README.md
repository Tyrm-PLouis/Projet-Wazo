# Introduction to Virtual Reality Project
## Codename : WAZO
This project has been made in the context of an introduction to using Unity to develop VR software and learn some blender basics.
We had to design our game and a mascot in 3D to implement then in the project.
After the design part complete, we had a few weeks to develop in unity, while encountering some bugs and the usage of Meta Quest 2 to test.
